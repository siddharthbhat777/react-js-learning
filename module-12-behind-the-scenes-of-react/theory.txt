Problem Definition:
1. As you can see in this app, that when we click on the button, all of the child components gets re-rendered.
2. Even after passing a static prop i.e. no change in the state of component, still it gets re-rendered with other child components.
3. So re-rendering all child components is unnecessary as well as it aftect app performance.
